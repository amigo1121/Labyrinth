# Introduction

This is my school project. The purpose is creating an interactive game that base on the boardgame Labyrinth (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMQ5GaBKXus)

# Installation

This game runs on plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You just need to clone it down and run it on your local machine using Live Sever.
